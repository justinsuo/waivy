/**
 * Macro-friendly recipe library — 2,000 original dishes, each with three
 * complete, independently-followable variants:
 *   • original          — the standard recipe
 *   • calorie-friendly  — lower calorie density via smart substitutions
 *   • protein-friendly  — higher protein via lean-protein boosts
 *
 * Variants share a `variantGroup` slug and are linked by `variantType`.
 * Per-serving macros are pre-computed from INGREDIENT_NUTRITION (USDA-based)
 * and stored in `estimatedNutrition`.
 *
 * This array is intentionally separate from RECIPES so it does NOT generate
 * static /recipes/[id] pages. The Nourish feature's RecipesTab consumes both
 * RECIPES and MACRO_RECIPES for logging.
