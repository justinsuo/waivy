/**
 * The set of `srf:` storage keys that participate in cross-device sync.
 *
 * These are user-AUTHORED documents (pantry, grocery, saved, custom recipes &
 * ingredients, pricing prefs, progress, and the full Nourish tracker). Each is
 * an independently JSON-serializable blob — the sync engine treats every key as
 * one syncable document and reconciles with per-key last-write-wins.
 *
 * Deliberately EXCLUDED (local-only / regenerable, would bloat or break sync):
 *   srf:custom-recipe-images  — base64 image blobs (up to ~6MB); mobile keeps
 *                               these on the device filesystem instead.
 *   srf:resolved-cache        — AI ingredient-resolution cache
 *   srf:nourish-food-cache    — USDA lookup cache (24h TTL)
 *   srf:ai-price-book         — AI price cache
 *   srf:recent-searches       — local UX nicety
 *   srf:nourish-adaptive-last-run — local scheduler timestamp
